Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative based on their textual content.

Dataset

Source: IMDB 50K Movie Reviews Dataset

Columns:

review: Textual content of the movie review

sentiment: Sentiment label (Positive/Negative)

Preprocessing Steps

Tokenization: Split text into individual words.

Stopword Removal: Remove common words that do not contribute to sentiment.

Lemmatization/Stemming: Reduce words to their base form.

Feature Engineering

TF-IDF Vectorization: Convert text data into numerical format using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).
